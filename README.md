# Building an Airline Booking Application based on Microservices Architecture on IBM Cloud Private

In this Code Pattern, we will build a cloudnative application based on microservice architecture, IBM Middlewares and following [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/) practices. This application is an airline booking app, and the technologies behind it are:

* Node.js (TypeScript)
* IBM Db2
* IBM ODM
* RabbitMQ
* Celery
* Angular
* Hyperledger Fabric
* Hyperledger Burrow
* Solidity
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* IBM Cloud Private

"Cloud native application" is a buzzword these days. Technologies like Kubernetes and Docker are picking up reputation and popularity in a cloud native world. This pattern will show the end-to-end process of building a highly available cloud native application on IBM Cloud Private. The application backend is written in Node.js and uses Db2 as a database. The frontend is built using Angular4. The distributed, asynchronous task queue is based on RabbitMQ and Celery. Container orchestration is managed by Kubernetes. Finally, the blockchain is based on Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Burrow and Ethereum Smart Contract.

## Learning objectives

When you've completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Break the application into different microservices
* Deploy microservices based application on IBM Cloud Private
* Leverage IBM Middlewares such as ODM and Db2 on Kubernetes
* Design business rules and decision making by IBM ODM
* Create distributed task queues using RabbitMQ and Celery
* Leverage Db2 as backend data storage
* Deploy Ethereum smart contract on Hyperledger fabric by leveraging Hyperledger Burrow
* Learn how to use IBM Cloud Private, Docker, and Kubernetes

3. ![icp10](icp10.png)

## Flow

1. *USER*: End user who will access the application
2. *APPUI*: The user interface is built using Angular4. It leverages restful endpoints by backend microservices
3. *Login Microservice*: This Microservice allows the user to login to the application
4. *Signup Microservice*: This Microservice allows the user to signup to the application
5. *Checkin Microservice*: This Microservice allows the user to checkin to a given booked flight
6. *Listing Microservice*: This Microservice allows the user to list and browse the available flights
7. *Booking Microservice*: This Microservice allows the user to book an available flight
8. *Blockchain Microservice*: This Microservice helps to communicate with the Blockchain
9. *IBM Db2*: SQL Database for storing data
10. *ODM Microservice*: This Microservice helps to communicate with the ODM Service
11. *ODM*: IBM Operational Decision Manager is an advanced business rules management system that helps you capture, automate and govern frequent, repeatable business decisions and adds real-time decision making to your day-to-day operations
12. *Email Microservice*: Email Microservice communicates with RabbitMQ and Celery to send email in asynchronous queues
13. *RabbitMQ*: RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received.
14. *Celery*: Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing
15. *Ethereum Proxy*: Allows to communicate with Ethereum Virtual Machine
16. *Hyperledger Burrow EVM Chaincode Plugin*: Allows Ethereum Capabilities on top of Hyperledger Fabric by leveraging Hyperledger Burrow
17. *Hyperledger Fabric*: Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain framework implementation and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture, Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play
